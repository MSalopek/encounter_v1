## How to use
![](docs/how_to.gif)
Using the simple UI new players can be quickly added. You can also create groups of players by increasing their number in the "Create" field.

Clicking on a player turns its box green -- signaling that the player should take their turn.

Clicking on the red gavel icon turns the player box gray -- signaling that the player is down or inactive.

#### Built with HTML/CSS + JavaScript/jQuery
